Specifically, it focuses on how French', 'learners of Italian as L2, representing two different', 'competence levels (lower and higher), realize geminates (non-', 'native sounds) in two different contexts (less and more rich).', 'A rich context is expected to induce lower accuracy. Acoustic', 'data of nine subjects (three beginners, three advanced and', 'three natives as control) were collected and analyzed in order', 'to observe: 1) the realization of geminates (duration of the', 'consonant and preceding vowel as an index of accuracy); and', ') the speech fluency (number and duration of disfluencies;', ""speech/articulation rate). Results suggest that learners'"", 'productions are affected by L1, above all in the case of', 'beginners, who show a lower degree of accuracy. As regards', 'the accuracy and context interaction, results show that the', 'production of geminates is more accurate (longer duration) in', 'poor than in rich context. Further, a higher number of', 'disfluencies is found in rich than in poor context.', 'Index Terms: geminates, Italian as L2, context, L2 speech', 'accuracy, L2 speech fluency.', '. Introduction', 'It is well known that accuracy in L2 speech is affected by the', 'characteristics of L1 [1] and, thus, investigating accuracy in', 'L2 pronunciation offers an overview of the interaction of the', 'L1 and L2 systems. For instance, the production of Italian', 'geminates by French speakers is expected to lack in accuracy,', 'as gemination is not familiar to French. The duration of', 'consonants is a contrastive feature in Italian so that words', 'have a different meaning in case a singleton (C) or a geminate', '(CC) consonant appears [2]. Moreover, gemination implies a', 'change not only in the duration of the consonant but also in', 'the duration of the preceding vowel, which is shorter when', 'followed by CC and it is longer before C [3]. On the contrary,', 'French does not have gemination, except for the uvular', 'approximant within the opposition between the imperfect', 'tense and the conditional mood (e.g. pourait vs. pourrait) [4].', 'Thus, gemination represents an interesting phenomenon to', 'investigate the interaction between a French-L1 and an Italian-', 'L2 system.', 'The production of the geminates can be problematic for', 'L2 learners [5,6,7,8] and accuracy in production also has an', 'important', 'impact', 'on', 'comprehension.', 'Thus,', 'studying', 'pronunciation accuracy of L2 non-native sounds gives', ""suggestion on learner's ability in communication.

Nevertheless,', 'in the literature, phonetic and phonological errors are reported', 'to account only for about 22% of L2 speech comprehension', '[10,11]. However, studies conducted on L2 pronunciation', 'often regard English as L2. Further, the context in which', 'communication takes place may heavily affect the accuracy in', 'producing the intended message as well as its comprehension', '(see Hyper and Hypo-articulation theory [11]).', 'Thus, it may be interesting: 1) to observe the interaction', 'between', 'phonetic-phonological', 'systems', 'different', 'from', 'English, such Italian as L2 spoken by French learners; and 2)', 'to investigate the role of context on both production accuracy', 'and speech fluency.', '.
