'different attributes, a couple of general comments are in order.', 'first, any corpus developed needs to strongly consider the', 'application(s) that it is addressing. for example, a corpus to', 'support speaker-recognition research in forensic speaker', 'recognition is likely very different than one for automatic', 'speaker labeling of meetings. to support application-relevant', 'scientific research, the corpus should support control variables', 'and dependent variables that are relevant to the intended', 'applications. this is not necessarily the same design as for a', 'corpus that is designed to be predictive of performance in a', 'given application, especially when many variables can be', 'involved. second, the application(s) under consideration', 'determine the meaningful measures of performance, namely', 'what metric(s) should be used. good metric designs consider', 'specific user-community needs to be informative to the', 'research and the user communities. furthermore, measures of', 'effectiveness can be used to measure task performance for', 'human consumers of speaker recognition methods. a deep', 'discussion of metrics is beyond the scope and focus of this', 'paper, but there are many good publications related to metrics,', 'such as [8] [9] [10].', 'given these general concepts for speaker-recognition data', 'collections, we focus on the
