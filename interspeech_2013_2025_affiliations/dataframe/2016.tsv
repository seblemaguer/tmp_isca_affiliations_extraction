This', 'paper focuses on within-class covariance normalization', '(WCCN) and shows that a reduction in training data', 'requirements can be achieved by proper data selection. In', 'particular, it is shown that the key variables are the total', 'amount of data and the degree of handset variability, with total', 'calls per handset playing a smaller role. The study offers', 'insight into efficient WCCN training data collection in real', 'world applications.', 'Index Terms: channel compensation, i-vectors, within-class', 'covariance, hyperparameter training', '. Introduction', 'The', 'recent', 'development', 'of', 'low', 'dimensional', 'vector', 'representations of speech utterances has led to considerable', 'improvement in the performance of speaker recognition', ""systems submitted to NIST's periodic speaker recognition"", 'evaluations. In particular, the i-vector method, which models', 'the speech utterance in a total variability subspace, has', 'emerged as the predominant approach [1]. Of equal', 'importance is the robustness of the recognizer to channel and', 'session variability, an area that has a long history of', 'development. Classical feature domain techniques that have', 'become standard components of many feature extraction front-', 'ends include cepstral mean subtraction, RASTA, feature', 'normalization, feature mapping, and feature warping [2-6].', 'With the introduction of i-vectors and their low dimensional', 'property, advanced techniques that model the channel/session', 'subspace of utterances, such as nuisance attribute projection', '(NAP), within-class covariance normalization (WCCN), linear', 'discriminant analysis (LDA), probabilistic linear discriminant', 'analysis (PLDA), and length normalization [7-10] have given', 'researchers effective tools for performing', 'channel and', 'intersession compensation. These latter methods, which', '*This work was sponsored by the Department of Defense under Air Force', 'contract FA8721-05-C-0002. Opinions, interpretations, conclusions, and', 'recommendations are those of the authors and are not necessarily endorsed by', 'the United States Government', 'require the estimation of a within-class and, in some cases,', 'between-class covariance matrices, rely on the availability of', 'multiple utterances from a large population of speakers.', 'Fortunately, participants in NIST evaluations have access to a', 'repository of legacy data from earlier tests that contains large', 'quantities of labeled speaker data, including numerous', 'instances of utterances recorded by a single speaker using the', 'same or different phone numbers. This resource allows', 'participants to evaluate compensation techniques and assess', 'their effectiveness simply by using all the available data or a', 'subset obtained during the development cycle. The system is', 'thus tuned for optimum performance, and in subsequent', 'evaluations more legacy data becomes available and the', 'process is repeated.', 'Although this procedure has been effective, it has two', 'drawbacks. First, little if any understanding is gained as to the', 'required characteristics of the compensation training data, and', 'second, the process will not necessarily be sustainable for real', 'world applications where acquisition of such training labeled', 'data may be expensive. To our knowledge, little if any', 'attention has been paid to the problem of the efficient', 'collection and selection of compensation data, and we have', 'thus designed a series of experiments to gain insight into this', 'issue.

For example, a corpus to', 'support speaker-recognition research in forensic speaker', 'recognition is likely very different than one for automatic', 'speaker labeling of meetings. To support application-relevant', 'scientific research, the corpus should support control variables', 'and dependent variables that are relevant to the intended', 'applications. This is not necessarily the same design as for a', 'corpus that is designed to be predictive of performance in a', 'given application, especially when many variables can be', 'involved. Second, the application(s) under consideration', 'determine the meaningful measures of performance, namely', 'what metric(s) should be used. Good metric designs consider', 'specific user-community needs to be informative to the', 'research and the user communities. Furthermore, measures of', 'effectiveness can be used to measure task performance for', 'human consumers of speaker recognition methods. A deep', 'discussion of metrics is beyond the scope and focus of this', 'paper, but there are many good publications related to metrics,', 'such as [8] [9] [10].', 'Given these general concepts for speaker-recognition data', 'collections, we focus on the desirable attributes referred to', 'earlier. These attributes include those driven by the specific', 'effects to be studied and those driven by the nature of', 'statistics.

It has been shown that under certain conditions the', 'reconstructed speech using IBMs provides the optimal SNR', 'gain among all binary masks (BMs) [11] and is highly', 'intelligible [12]. Therefore the T-F bins of IBMs are useful as', 'training labels for classification systems such as commonly', 'implemented deep learning architectures [13]–[15] or the Multi', 'Layered Random Forest method proposed in this paper.', 'Other approaches such as speech enhancement techniques', 'include spectral subtraction, Wiener filtering, and subspace', 'based methods [16]. The model-based approaches such as Non-', 'Negative Sparse Coding (NNSC) [17], [18] have been', 'extensively used for separating audio signals such as speech,', 'noise and music. Recently deep learning architectures such as', 'Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have shown state-of-the-', 'art performance in monaural source separation (MSS) [13],', '[19].', 'We propose a novel CASA method, called Multi Layered', 'Random Forest (MLRF) for learning BMs for both audio', 'sources in a mixture. The Random Forest (RF) method maps a', 'high-dimensional input vector (features) to an output class (in', 'our case 0 or 1) which is (a value of) a T-F bin in the BM. After', 'a first classification, the BM is used to create additional features', 'that are provided to the subsequent RF classifiers (later called', 'layers). The final BM is then applied to a test mixture', 'spectrogram to obtain estimates of the source spectrograms that', 'are inverted back to the audio domain.', 'In summary, our work makes four contributions. First, we', 'train RF classifiers for individual frequency bands similar to', '[15], thereby enhancing the performance of MSS. This is', 'motivated by the observation that T-F neighborhood statistics', 'of structured audio data such as speech, music and others are', 'frequency dependent [20].

To achieve a high classification recall for both sources', 'simultaneously, an equal number of dominant samples are', 'chosen for each source. Third, the input feature vectors are', 'constructed using various linear transformations on a frequency', 'specific T-F neighborhood.

INTRODUCTION', 'Automatic speech recognition (ASR) in clean/matched acoustical', 'environments has become a less challenging problem.', 'However,', 'once the signal gets corrupted by noise ASR performance starts to', 'degrade with a rate that depends on the type and level of the distur-', 'bance. Both the recognition front-end and back-end can be modi-', 'fied in order to mitigate the sensitivity of the system to the environ-', 'mental distortions. Three main strategies may be adopted in deal-', 'ing with this issue [1', ']. First, the signal may be passed through', 'a pre-processing enhancement stage prior to being supplied to the', 'parametrisation block. Second, the feature extraction techniques can', 'be modified to produce features that are more robust against the dis-', 'tortions induced by noise [3–6]. A third solution is modification of', 'the back-end to increase its ability to cope with noise, either through', 'model compensation/adaptation or by using the noise data during', 'the training phase (multi-style training). One of the most successful', 'approaches to robust speech recognition is the vector Taylor series', '(VTS) method [7]. In this approach, Taylor series expansion is em-', 'ployed to linearise the non-linear relationship between the clean and', 'noisy representations. This method has been studied from several', 'different perspectives [8–11] and can produce state-of-the-art per-', 'formance improvements.', 'However, the VTS method is not ﬂexible in terms of the features', 'it can enhance. Specifically, it can only be used for MFCC or log', 'filterbank energies (FBE) and can not be directly applied to repre-', 'sentations which – instead of log compression – apply a power trans-', 'formation to the FBEs.
