In this work, we', 'examine the articulatory components of speech reflected in', 'formant tracks, and how changes in track dynamics and', 'coordination map to cognitive decline. We address a', 'population of athletes regularly receiving impacts to the head', 'and showing signs of preclinical mild traumatic brain injury', '(mTBI), a state indicated by impaired cognitive performance', 'occurring prior to concussion. We hypothesize that this', 'preclinical damage results in 1) changes in average vocal tract', 'dynamics measured by formant frequencies, their velocities,', 'and acceleration, and 2) changes in articulatory coordination', 'measured by a novel formant-frequency cross-correlation', 'characterization. These features allow machine learning', 'algorithms to detect preclinical mTBI identified by a battery of', 'cognitive tests. A comparison is performed of the effectiveness', 'of', 'vocal', 'tract', 'dynamics', 'features', 'versus', 'articulatory', 'coordination features.  This evaluation is done using receiver', 'operating characteristic (ROC) curves along with confidence', 'bounds.  The articulatory dynamics features achieve area', 'under the ROC curve (AUC) values between 0.72 and 0.98,', 'whereas the articulatory coordination features achieve AUC', 'values between 0.94 and 0.97.', 'Index Terms: concussion, formant dynamics, formant', 'coordination, speech analysis, mild traumatic brain injury', '(mTBI)', '. Introduction', 'Traumatic brain injury is known to affect various components', 'of voice including the source, prosody, and articulation of', 'production. These observations have been exploited in speech', 'pathology for diagnosis [1] and in automatic detection of', 'traumatic events from vocal features [2]. In this paper, we', 'focus on the articulation component of production, as', 'manifested by vocal tract formant frequencies. Previous', 'This work is sponsored by the Assistant Secretary of Defense', 'for Research & Engineering under Air Force contract', '#FA8721-05-C-0002. Opinions, interpretations, conclusions,', 'and recommendations are those of the authors and are not', 'necessarily endorsed by the United States Government.', 'studies have shown that changes in average formant-frequency', 'dynamics [3] or in a novel characterization of articulatory', 'coordination using formant track correlations [4] can be used', 'to identify or predict depression severity as determined  by', 'standard clinical assessment. This paper investigates both of', 'these vocal tract formant representations in a population', 'showing non-physician assessed cognitive impairment. This is', 'a common occurrence among football and soccer athletes, who', 'regularly receive head impacts [5][6]. While each impact may', 'not cause a concussion, also known as a mild traumatic brain', 'injury (mTBI), repeated exposure to head impacts can cause', 'neurocognitive and neurophysiological impairments prior to', 'concussion (preclinical mTBI) [6]. In order to limit the long-', 'term neurological deficits due to repeated preclinical injury,', 'we aim to develop an easily obtainable biomarker for detecting', 'cognitive change. Specifically, we hypothesize that a classifier', 'trained using formant track dynamics and coordination will be', 'able to reliably predict cognitive decline. Such a classifier', 'could detect preclinical damage that accumulates prior to', 'concussion, and determine readiness to return to activity by', 'identifying the point at which an individual has returned to', 'baseline neurocognitive function.', 'This work is motivated by prior clinical and automatic', 'classification research, which has demonstrated a relation', 'between head trauma and signals associated with vocal', 'dynamics [1][2]. Using speech collected from a group of 32', 'high school athletes reciting a standard read passage, we', 'extract', 'formant', 'tracks', 'and', 'measure', 'dynamics-', 'and', 'coordination-based features. These features are applied to a', 'support vector machine (SVM) classifier to detect changes in', 'cognitive performance, determined by the Immediate Post-', 'Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT)', 'suite [7] in three areas: visual memory, visual motor speed,', 'and reaction time. The ability to detect cognitive performance', 'decline based on these features is evaluated using receiver', 'operator characteristic (ROC) curves.', 'The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we', 'describe the high school football- and soccer-athlete data', 'collection, including the ImPACT cognitive test. Section 3', 'provides methods to extract features based on dynamics and', 'coordination of formant tracks, while Section 4 gives results of', 'correlating these features with components of the ImPACT', 'test.

Introduction', 'Extracting individual sources from a mixture of several audio', 'signals is required in many applications including hearing', 'aids, automatic meeting transcription systems, polyphonic', 'music source separation and hands-free teleconference', 'systems.

In [2],', 'the same NTF modeling is considered and the performance of', 'the EM algorithm is measured and compared with the', 'Multiplicative Update (MU) solution.

Secondly, the number of sources is taken known in', 'advance to enable them to cluster the learned spectral', 'components.', 'In a recent work [3], a Bayesian non-parametric approach', 'is considered for estimating the number of sources, channel', 'coefficients and individual source signals.

In short, designing an appro-', 'priate feature representation is challenging.', 'Deep scattering networks (DSN) [7] have recently been in-', 'troduced to address some of the above challenges. DSNs take', 'a raw-signal and generate a contractive representation, which', 'preserves signal energy, while ensuring Lipschitz continuity to', 'deformations ([7] and [8]).

In our exploration of DSS features for LVCSR,', 'we introduce many novelties in this paper.
