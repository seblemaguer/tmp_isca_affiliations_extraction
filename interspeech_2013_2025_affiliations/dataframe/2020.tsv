michelas20_interspeech	"['Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, LPL, Aix-en-Provence, France', 'In two long-term repetition priming experiments, we', 'investigated how accentual information is processed and', ""represented in the French listeners' mind. Repeated prime and"", ""target words either matched (/b  'do/ - / b  'do/ ‘headband') or"", ""mismatched in their accentual patterns (/b  do/ - /b  'do/). In"", 'experiment 1, the target words were presented in the left ear', 'only, and attenuation in the repetition priming effect was', 'observed when the primes and the targets mismatched in their', 'accentual pattern. The differential priming effect between', 'match and mismatch primes was no longer observed in', 'Experiment 2 when the targets were presented in the right ear', 'only. Together, these results showed that accentual variation at', 'the word level in French is treated as related-talker variation,', 'and only influences word recognition under specific', 'circumstances, in particular, when we push word processing in', 'the right hemisphere.', 'Index Terms: spoken word recognition; French prosody;', 'primary accent; hemispheric dominance.', '. Introduction', 'Most of Germanic and Romance languages use lexical stress.', 'Stress placement is thus assigned at the word level and the', 'position of stress within word can change its meaning. In these', 'languages, stress information appears to be a nondetachable', 'aspect of phonemic information and the two types of', 'information similarly influence word recognition. Contrary to', 'these languages, French does not have lexical stress and', 'French listeners have been found to experience stress deafness', '([1]). On the other hand, French has phrasal accent, meaning', 'that accent always affects the last syllable of a larger unit than', 'the word, that is the accentual phrase (e.g., [2], [3], [4]). As a', ""result, the same word receives accent ([un petit 'CHOU]) “a"", ""little cabbage” or not ([un CHOU 'bleu]) “a blue cabbage”"", 'depending on its position within the accentual phrase. Since', 'accent in French signals the end of accentual phrases and thus', 'the end of words occurring at the end of accentual phrases, it', 'has a demarcation function ([5]). Nonetheless, in French,', 'accent has not a lexically contrastive function, and as', 'indicated in the preceding example, the word CHOU, whether', 'accented or not, conserves the same meaning. Does this mean', 'however that accentual information never influences spoken', 'word recognition in this language? This is precisely the', 'question we addressed in this study by examining how', 'accentual information is processed and represented in the', 'mind of French listeners.', 'Because in French accent always affects the last syllable', 'of words located at the end of accentual phrases, several', 'studies have shown that French listeners use it to segment', 'speech into words, and in particular to locate word offset/onset', 'in continuous speech ([6], [7], [8], [9], [10]). For example, [8]', 'showed that accent helps French listeners to resolve', 'competition between overlapping lexical candidates. The', 'authors asked participants to detect a target word (e.g., CHAT', ""“cat”) in sentences like [Le CHAT grin'cheux] “the grumpy"", 'cat” in which only the word grincheux bears accent on its last', ""syllable or in sentences like [Le CHAT'] [grim'pait] “the cat"", 'climbed up” in which both the words chat and grimpait bear', 'primary accent. They found slower detection times in [Le', ""CHAT grin'cheux] than in [Le CHAT'] [grim'pait]. The"", ""slower detection of CHAT in [Le CHAT grin'cheux] has been"", 'interpreted as resulting from competition between CHAT and', 'its competitor CHAGRIN “sadness”. In this case, since there is', 'no accent on CHAT to indicate its end, the word CHAGRIN', 'remains active and competes with the word CHAT. The results', ""of Christophe et al.'s thus suggest that French listeners insert a"", 'word-final boundary each time they encounter an accented', 'syllable. Consequently, accentual information in French', 'appears to boost word recognition process by preventing', 'activation of inappropriate lexical candidates.', 'In a recent study ([11]), we have examined whether', 'accentual information could be stored in the French mental', 'lexicon. This question is particularly relevant for models of', 'spoken word recognition assuming that multiple variants of a', 'same word encoding fine-grained acoustic details are stored in', 'memory ([12]). Because French listeners are inevitably', 'exposed to the accented and unaccented versions of words, a', 'possibility within this class of models is that French listeners', 'have created lexical traces corresponding to the accented and', 'unaccented forms of words.  In our study, participants heard a', 'first block of stimuli, the prime block, followed by a second', 'block of stimuli, the target block. Some of the words from the', 'prime block were repeated in the target block. The repeated', ""primes and targets either matched (e.g., (/b  'do/ - /b  'do/"", ""‘headband') or mismatched (/b  do/ - /b  'do/) in their"", 'accentuation. In comparison to a control condition in which', ""primes and targets were unrelated (/maʁ  / - / b  'do/ “chestnut-"", 'headband”), we reported that match and mismatch primes', 'were equally effective in facilitating the subsequent processing', 'of the target words.  The observation that a change in the', 'accentual pattern of words has no impact on the magnitude of', 'the repetition priming effect indicates that accented and', 'unaccented variants of words activate the same-form based', 'representations. Hence, words in their different accentuation', 'appear to be associated with a single representation in the', 'French mental lexicon. Our results are thus more compatible', 'with the view of an abstract lexicon that does not encode fine-', 'grained acoustic details ([13], [14], [15], [16], [17]).', 'Given this finding, we ask here how French listeners used', 'accentual information during spoken word recognition.

Introduction', 'Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems are becoming', 'ubiquitous not only in the human-computer interaction systems,', 'such as voice assistants or dictation tools, but also in systems', 'processing human-human conversations. The abundance of the', 'available audio data makes it very tempting to use conversa-', 'tion transcripts as input data for spoken language understand-', 'ing. Most commercially available ASR systems do not produce', 'any punctuation or capitalization of output transcripts, which is', 'a serious limitation with respect to many downstream tasks. The', 'prerequisite for true spoken language understanding is the abi-', 'lity to comprehend spoken utterances, both at the semantic and', 'syntactic level. The latter requires a robust dependency parsing,', 'which, in turn, partially relies on correct punctuation.', 'Punctuation is also indispensable for intent annotation.', 'Consider the task of annotating instances of a negative senti-', 'ment in call transcripts. The phrase ”nobody came back and', ""I don't like I said, he didn't leave a slip” would be incorrectly"", 'marked as an instance of negative sentiment due to the pres-', ""ence of the utterance ”I don't like,” whereas in reality the phrase"", ""should be punctuated as ”nobody came back and I don't, like"", ""I said, he didn't leave a slip.” In general, missing punctuation"", ""can introduce errors for phrases with personal references (”let's"", ""eat grandma” vs. ”let's eat, grandma”), enumerations (”I love"", 'cooking my family and pets” vs. ”I love cooking, my family,', 'and pets”), or prepositions at sentence boundaries (”taken care', 'of the refund” vs. ”taken care of. The refund”). The problem', 'of the inherent lack of punctuation is exacerbated by the pres-', 'ence of stochastic ASR errors, which for spontaneous human-', 'human conversations can amount to 15%-20% of transcribed', 'words [1]. Consider the following transcript: ”Hi my name is', 'e agent will do I have pleasure speaking with today”. It may', 'be very challenging to correctly introduce punctuation since the', 'actual utterance is ”Hi my name is Adrian who do I have plea-', 'sure speaking with today.”', 'Spontaneous speech is very different not only from the', 'written language, but from other types of speech as well [2].', 'Scripted speech and human-computer conversations tend to', 'have well-defined structure with clear demarcation of sentence-', 'like units, correct SVO (subject-verb-object) structures, and', 'limited vocabulary. Spontaneous speech, on the other hand, is', 'filled with all types of disﬂuencies which can account for 5%', 'of all words and affect more than 30% of utterances. These', 'disﬂuencies, which include backchannel markers, coordinat-', 'ing conjunctions, discourse markers, or filled pauses, hinder', 'transcript translation, summarization, information extraction, or', 'readability of transcripts. At the same time, the disﬂuencies are', 'known to play an important role in the management of interac-', 'tions, for instance, in upholding the turn by a speaker.', 'An important, yet often overlooked, aspect of spontaneous', 'human-human conversations is the overlap of utterances [3]. As', 'previous research suggests, the overlap in conversational speech', 'is substantial, and it is as frequent in phone conversations be-', 'tween strangers as in face-to-face meetings between close ac-', 'quaintances. The presence of the overlap makes diarization of', 'speech more difficult, which also affects the ability to model the', 'turn-taking realistically. Interestingly, we can see that the occur-', 'rence of the overlap changes the structure of utterances as the', 'speakers react dynamically to the interruptions by repeating cer-', 'tain phrases, correcting, or deleting them. An example of such', 'a change might be the increased number of question marks –', 'speakers use questions much more often than in regular speech,', 'not only due to the conversational nature of the exchange, but', 'also the need to request acknowledgements of comprehension', 'or verify comprehension by paraphrasing.', 'In principle, any punctuated text can be used to train a punc-', 'tuation model. Unfortunately, most of the available textual cor-', 'pora are not representative of spontaneous speech.', 'Patterns', 'learned from Wikipedia, Web Crawl, or news corpora, hardly', 'generalize to the transcripts of spontaneous conversations.
