Abstract', 'In this paper, we present a method of combining a visual', 'text reader with a system of automatic speech recognition to', 'suppress errors when encountering out-of-vocabulary words –', 'specifically names.', 'The visual text reader outputs detected', 'words that are mapped into a large list of names via the Leven-', 'shtein distance. The detected names are inserted into the class-', 'based language model on the ﬂy which improves recognition', 'results. To demonstrate the effect on the real speech recog-', 'nition task we use data from sports TV broadcasting where a', 'lot of names are present in both the audio and video streams.', 'We superseded manual vocabulary editing in live TV subtitling', 'through respeaking by an automated online process. Further, we', 'show that automatically adding the names to the recognition vo-', 'cabulary online and with forgetting lowers the WER relatively', 'by 39 % in comparison with the case when names of all sports-', 'men are added to the vocabulary beforehand and by 15 % when', 'only the relevant names are added beforehand.', '. Introduction', 'With the rapid development in the field of Automatic Speech', 'Recognition (ASR) over the last decades, real-time Large Vo-', 'cabulary Continuous Speech Recognition (LVCSR) is being', 'used as a cost-effective alternative to live TV subtitling over', 'manual keyboard transcriptions. Since ASR technology is still', 'not able to automatically transcribe any television broadcast', 'with acceptable accuracy, so-called respeaking – a technique in', 'which a professional respeaker listens to the source audio and', 'dictates it in a quiet environment to the well-tailored speech', 'recognition system – has consolidated as the most widely', 'adopted live subtitling technique. Live subtitling through res-', 'peaking was pioneered by British BBC in 2003 [1] and now it', 'is used all over the world. At our department, we have devel-', 'oped our own remote live subtitling solution with many inno-', 'vations [2]. Now, we provide live subtitles for the Czech tele-', 'vision, the public service broadcaster in the Czech Republic,', 'mainly for live sports broadcasting.', 'Even with large vocabularies, the major problem of live', 'subtitling of sports TV programs is Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV)', 'words, especially the names of sportsmen and teams, which', 'cannot be covered by any real language model training data.', 'Many OOV related papers were published, for example, using', 'OOV detector for named entities recognition [3] or proposing', 'OOV recovery based on sub-word units [4], but these methods', 'are not usable in the task of live TV subtitling. In our case, the', 'sports event participants are usually known in advance, so we', 'solved this problem with a class-based language model, where', 'its classes should be filled before each live subtitling. Since', 'each sport has its specific terms and phrases that are commonly', 'used during TV commentary of the sport, we manually tran-', 'scribed TV commentaries of 40 different sports (e.g. baseball,', 'golf, figure skating or shooting). Each name of a player, com-', 'petitor, team, nationality or sports place in these manual tran-', 'scriptions was labeled. The names that did not relate to the', 'transcribed match or competition were not labeled, because the', 'commentators may use them freely (e.g. legendary sportsmen', 'such as ”Bjoerndalen”, ”Plyushchenko” or ”Jagr”). Different', 'labels were used for the names of players or competitors, for', 'the names of competing teams or countries or participant na-', 'tionalities and for the designations of sports places. In addition,', 'each label was supplemented by a number representing one of', 'grammatical cases (i.e. different word forms) of the expres-', 'sion. Finally, taking into account the above-mentioned labels', 'instead of the individual words, class-based language model', 'with 18 classes (6 classes for players and competitors', ' classes', 'for teams and nationalities and 6 classes for sports places) was', 'trained for each sport (see [5] for details). After mixing with', 'other relevant language model training data, resulting trigram', 'language models incorporate about 550k words for each differ-', 'ent sports domain.', 'Before each live subtitling session, the respeaker adds the', 'names and surnames of sportsmen participating in the match or', 'competition to the recognition system based on official start lists', 'published on the web pages or other relevant sources. Language', 'model classes are then filled with names and surnames auto-', 'matically inﬂected (rule-based) to 6 grammatical cases. Both a', 'surname only and a combination of name and surname are gen-', 'erated. By default, all names within one class have the same', 'weight, so uniform probability distribution is used.
