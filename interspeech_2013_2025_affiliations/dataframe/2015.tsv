Introduction', 'Over recent years, many approaches based on Gaussian mixture', 'model–universal background model (GMM-UBM) [1] have been', 'proposed for speaker verification [2]. Based upon similar', 'framework as the eigenvoice model [3], the i-vector was pro-', 'posed in [4] and soon became the mainstream method in speaker', 'verification. Similar to a supervector [5], an i-vector is a fixed-', 'length representation of a speech utterance, which typically con-', 'sists of varying number of frames. Besides, an i-vector offers a', 'low-dimensional representation of the total variability, contain-', 'ing both speaker and channel information, rendered in an utter-', 'ance. Channel compensation could then be performed using the', 'probabilistic linear discriminant analysis (PLDA) [6], which', 'also serves as the backend classifier.', 'I-vectors have proven to be very effective for text-', 'independent verification when both the training and test utter-', 'ances are of long duration. In text-constrained speaker verifica-', 'tion task, the lexical content of the spoken utterances are con-', 'fined to a finite known set and always of short duration [7]. For', 'short utterances, the content mismatch between the enrollment', 'and test utterances makes it difficult for i-vectors to be applied', 'directly [8', ']. In [11], we proposed the local variability model', '(LVM) with the aim to capture the local variability associated', 'with individual Gaussians of the UBM. It unties a shared i-', 'vector among all the Gaussians by assigning a local variability', 'vector to each Gaussian component. LVM offers a flexible way', 'to compare two utterances in a content-wise manner which may', 'provide a viable solution to the content mismatch problem be-', 'tween utterances of short duration.', 'Individual Gaussian components of the UBM can be thought', 'of the representation of some low-level acoustic events [10].', 'However, it is generally difficult to associate such events to any', 'well-defined phonetic classes since the UBM is trained in an', 'unsupervised manner. The lexical content modeled by individual', 'Gaussians is therefore ambiguous without clear phonetic defini-', 'tion. This problem was addressed in [12] and [13], using deep', 'neural network (DNN) for i-vector extraction. With the DNN for', 'triphone models trained for automatic speech recognition (ASR),', 'speech frames are aligned to a predefined set of tied-states,', 'which are treated as Gaussian-like units in the i-vector frame-', 'work. Thus, every unit is endowed with clear phonetic meaning.', 'In [14], a method to perform the content-matching at the sta-', 'tistics level was proposed, which was shown to be effective for', 'the tasks where the lexical contents of the test utterance is con-', 'fined to those for enrolment. However, in such a method, the i-', 'vectors need to be estimated for the enrolment and test utteranc-', 'es in every trial, resulting in complex computation in the testing', 'phase. In this paper, treating the output nodes of a DNN trained', 'as a monophonic acoustic model for ASR as Gaussian-like units,', 'we propose to estimate the phone-centric local variability vectors.', 'The benefit of such phone-centric local vectors is that, they are', 'estimated independently before speaker comparison, and can be', 'selected to be compared according to their corresponding pho-', 'netic contents during the subsequent PLDA scoring, performing', 'content-matching.

However the overall', 'performance of the recognition systems and the usefulness of', 'the results are not necessarily considered. To address this', 'problem, we study and propose a metric which  replicates', 'human-annotated scores using their perception to the', 'recognition results. The features that we use are the numbers', 'of insertion errors, deletion errors, and substitution errors in', 'the characters and the syllables. In addition we studied the', 'numbers of consecutive errors, the misrecognized keywords,', 'and the locations of errors. We created models using linear', 'regression and random forest, predicted human-perceived', 'scores, and compared them with the actual scores using', ""Spearman's"", 'rank-based', 'correlation.', 'According', 'to our', 'experiments the correlation of human perceived scores with', 'character error rates is 0.456, while those with the predicted', 'scores by using a random forest of 10 features is 0.715. The', 'latter is close to the averaged correlation between the scores of', 'the human subjects', '.765, which suggests that we can predict', 'the human-perceived scores using those features and that we', 'can leverage human perception model for evaluating speech', 'recognition performance. The important factors (features) for', 'the prediction are the numbers of substitution errors and', 'consecutive errors.', 'Index Terms: speech recognition, evaluation, word error  rate,', 'character error rate, human perception', '. Introduction', 'Evaluation metrics are important for comparing various', 'algorithms for speech recognition and assessing which', 'approach outperforms the others.  The WER (Word Error', 'Rate) has been most often used in  research work on speech', 'recognition [1]. The CER (Character Error Rate) is also', 'popular in research for some languages (such as Japanese),', 'where the word units can be ambiguous [2]. In some', 'applications, task-oriented metrics have also been tried. For', 'example Levit proposed a metric for end-to-end accuracy', 'evaluation in voice-enabled search tasks [3].', '͊This work was conducted when the author was a member of', 'IBM Research - Tokyo', 'In addition, speech-enabled dialog systems have been usually', 'evaluated by the concept error rate, task completion ratio, or', 'required time and average number of turns to the completion', '[4][5], because the quality of dialog systems is affected not', 'only by the recognition accuracy but also by interpretation', 'algorithms and strategies of the dialog management. However,', 'in many speech applications such as dictation, voicemail', 'transcription, or message creation, the quality of the output', 'text, (its readability and understandability), is the largest factor', 'for evaluating the speech recognition systems. In this paper we', 'study the human-assessed quality of Automatic Speech', 'Recognition (ASR) output to rank the transcriptions in', 'Japanese where the orthographic and word units are hard to', 'define.', 'This paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we survey', 'related works. In Section 3 the strategy for collecting human', 'perceived scores from human annotators is described. In', 'Section 4, we discuss the features to be used for defining our', 'metrics. Section 5 presents our experimental results using two', 'frequently used approaches: linear regression and random', 'forest, a well-known non-linear prediction method. In Section', ', we discuss the results, followed by some concluding', 'remarks.', '. Related works', 'Jones [6] studied the readability of ASR transcripts, and', 'reported that certain metadata (capitalization, punctuation, and', 'disfluencies (removed or not)) significantly influenced the', 'human-perceived', 'readability.', 'Nanjo', '[7]', 'proposed', 'the', 'Weighted Key word Error Rate (WKER) as a more suitable', 'metric for evaluating ASR used in applications. The ASR', 'quality problem is similar in difficulty to assessing (or', 'automatically predicting) human reactions to machine', 'translation output . BLEU was proposed as a more objective', 'metric for evaluating machine translation [8]. However, the', 'relation between the metrics for speech recognition output and', 'human-perceived quality has not been sufficiently investigated.', 'We are investigating what and how the recognition errors', 'affect human perception of the ASR output.
